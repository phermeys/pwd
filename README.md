# pwd
Password Generator I built a while ago because I was sick of doing it manually

I have now dockerized it, and this can be run thusly. Once complete, it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8081`

Local port can be changed in the docker-compose file for now

```
git clone https://github.com/phermeys/pwd.git
cd pwd
docker-compose up -d
```
